# Learn To Code The Hard Way
This is a simple project I undertook in order to learn the fundamentals of Python programming.

The content for this was referenced from the book:
```sh
Learn Python 3 the Hard Way A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code by Zed A. Shaw
```
I will continue to add to it as I progress through the book.

Note:
>The **exe35.exe** executable was compiled using **pyinstaller** using code found in **ex35.py**

>Any file with **additional** or **plus** appended at the end is content I was able to additionally research online and use during the specific topic referenced at that chapter of the book
