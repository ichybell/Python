# Learn To Code The Hard Way
This is a simple project I undertook in order to learn the fundamentals of Python programming.

The content for this was referenced from the book:
```sh
Learn Python 3 the Hard Way A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code by Zed A. Shaw
```
I will continue to add to it as I progress through the book.

Note:
>The **.exe** executables were compiled using **pyinstaller** using code found in in their respective python modules

>Any file with **additional** or **plus** appended at the end is content I was able to additionally research online and use during the specific topic referenced at that chapter of the book

>My game that was to be created is a Word_Descrambler project which aims to form words from a series of letters provided. It can also be referred to as a Word Finder

>The image that is located at the gothonwebs project is the image I used to test the upload module
